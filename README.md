Each file has a breif description of it's role in the research below. For further details please read the paper or contact myself at ldillon97@gmail.com.
For specific files please email.

#### Definition of each file:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|AMR_gene_count.sh | This script was used to make gene counts from the gene outputs of RGI etc.|
|Cytoscape_analysis.md | Information on gene network plot (fig4) |
|Diamond_RGI_analysis.sh|-|
|Eggnog_analysis.py | Script used to make .arff files from Eggnog output|
|Eggnog_analysis.sh | The Eggnog script used on my genomes (a diamond input was used to split the analysis)|
| FIGURE_1.R | R code used to make Fig.1 |
| J48_2_Dot.sh | Converts J48 model into a .dot file (easier for visulisation|
|Logistic_regression_NCBI_AMRFinder.py | The logistic regression of NCBI AMRFinderPlusPlus output|
|Logistic_regression_RGI.py | The logistic regression of RGI output |
|Logistic_regression_ResFinder.py| The logistic regression of ResFinder output|
|NCBI_AMRFinder_analysis.sh | NCBIAMRFinder plusplus script used on my genomes|
|OG_RGI_analysis.py | Script showing how the original RGI analysis was perfomed|
|PATRIC_genomes.sh | Script used to download the genomes|
|Prodigal.sh | Prodigal script used onthe genomes|
|RGI_all_analysis.py | Script used to make .arff files from the RGI genes REGARDLESS of the antibiotic they target |
|RGI_analysis_WGS.sh | RGI script used on my genomes |
| RGI_pipeline_commands.md | This file describes how we got gene counts from the RGI gene output|
|RGI_specific_analysis.py | Script used to make .csv files from the RGI genes SPECIFIC to the antibiotic they target in the CARD db|
|ResFinder_WGS_analysis.sh | ResFinder script on my genomes|
|Stacked_barcharts_by_cog_cat.py | Script to make supplementary figure 8 (stacked barcharts)|
|Wilcoxon_test_accuracy_precision_recall.R | Stats test run to compare different model accuracy, precison, and recall|
|genome_ids.txt | This is the list if genomes downloaded from PATRIC (now BV-BRC)|
